## üó∫Ô∏è Urban Explorer 

A small but production-style Android app to catalog interesting urban spots with photos and notes. Built to demonstrate **modern Android** with a **clean, testable architecture**. The focus is on a modern Jetpack Compose UI, robust local data storage, and demonstrating Compose's interaction with traditional Android views.


## üéØ Why this project

I built Urban Explorer as a **showcase** of how I approach Android apps:

* Compose-first UI with **XML screens** integrated
* **MVVM + Clean Architecture**
* Clear **module boundaries** (domain/data/presentation, :feature based architecture)
* **Dependency Injection** for testability
* Room-backed offline storage with **Flows**
* **Unit + UI testing** with repository fakes
* **Scalability** in mind


## üîç Notes & Trade-offs

* Keep in mind that development was focused on highlighting structure, not features.
* Compose-first UI with XML interop to reflect real-world migration paths.
* Fakes in tests demonstrate UI behavior without a backend.

  
## ‚ú® Features

* Create, view, edit, and delete ‚Äúspots‚Äù
* Attach and display photos for a spot
* Local db storage (Room)
* Colors, themes, and fonts interoperability for Compose + XML use
* Creating test spots from About screen(XML)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

* **:Feature**: Features are split into their own modules based on features.
* **Presentation**: Jetpack Compose screens, XML screens `ViewModel`s (MVVM), immutable `UiState` via `StateFlow`, reusable components, UI models + providers.
* **Domain**: Use cases, models, repository interfaces, pure Kotlin.
* **Data**: Repository implementations, Room DAOs, mappers, one source of truth.
